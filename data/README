FORS_spec.txt

  A list of each observe with a spectrum from FORS. Columns give the
  object ID (use to match to the images in FORS_spec/), the template
  used to measure a redshift, the estimated redshift, the
  identification confidence (a=high confidence, b=uncertain,
  c=unknown) and the coordinates (degrees J2000).

FORS_spec/

  FORS 1d spectra and 2d spectral images, with a template overplotted
  at the redshift given in the table above.

LAE.txt

  The extracted FORS spectrum of the Lyman-alpha emitting galaxy at
  z=2.466. This has columns wavelength (Angstroms), flux (f_lambda),
  1-sigma flux uncertainty, and sky background. The dip to negative
  fluxes at 4500-4700 Angstroms is due to diffuse emission
  contaminating the sky in this spectral region. This is likely due to
  'Ly-alpha fuzz' associated with the background QSO Q0002-422, and so
  unrelated to the galaxy.

  The raw data for these observations can be downloaded from the ESO
  archive.

q0002m422_nhmc_cont.txt

  The combined, continuum-fitted UVES spectrum of QSO
  Q0002-422. Columns give the wavelength in (Angstroms), flux
  (f_lambda), 1 sigma flux uncertainty and continuum.

  The raw data for these observations can be downloaded from the ESO
  archive.
