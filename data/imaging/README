J000448-415729_slits.reg

  A ds9 region file showing he slit positions of our FORS observations.

specz.reg

  A ds9 region file showing the positions of objects with secure
  redshifts (green) or tentative redshifts (cyan) from FORS
  spectra. Several objects close to the QSO also have spectra taken
  with Magellan/IMACS. These will be made available in a future
  publication (Cooksey et al., in preparation).

  Script used to run sextractor on each of the images.
  
psf_sub.py
rsub.fits

  Script attempting a PSF subtraction of the QSO, and the subtracted r
  band image. There is an extended object closer to the QSO than the
  LAE but on the opposite side of the QSO psf. We don't have a
  redshift for this object, but the best explanation is a galaxy
  connected to the extremely strong MgII system (rest EW_2796=4.4 Ang)
  at z=0.836.
