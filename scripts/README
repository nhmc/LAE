averageTransmission.dat

  Output of IGMtransmission. Used by calc_extinct.py

LAE paper repo.ipynb.json
  
  An ipython notebook containing most of the calculations done for
  Sections 4 and 5. Figures 1 and 2 are also generated using this
  code.

HeII_gamma_check.py

  This is used to calculate the HeII and HI ionization rates for the
  incident UV slopes we use in Cloudy modelling. These values are then
  compared to the constrains from Worseck et al. 2014 in Appendix B2.

SED_mass_plot.py

  This generates Figure 3.

calc_extinct.py

  Calculates the extinction in u, g and r bands from IGMtransmission.

fig_metals2.py

  Makes Figure 4.

find_NHI_tot.py

  Makes Figure 5.

parplot.py

  Makes Figure 8.

plot_incident_field_trans.py

  Makes Figure B1.

plot_incident_field.py

  Makes Figure B2.

test_aUV_2.py

  Makes Figure B3.
