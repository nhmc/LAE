This repository has code and data used in the paper "Metal-enriched,
sub-kiloparsec gas clumps in the circumgalactic medium of a faint z =
2.5 galaxy" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4239). If you find any of the
data or code in this repository useful for a publication, please
consider citing that paper.

The following files and folders are included. Most directories contain
another README with information on their contents. Feel free to
